## (In Progress!) Interpreter written in Rust

### (based off book [Crafting Interpreters](https://www.amazon.com/Crafting-Interpreters-Robert-Nystrom/dp/0990582930/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=crafting+interpreters&qid=1656075200&sprefix=crafting+inter%2Caps%2C103&sr=8-1))

Very much in progress. Currently doesn't compile/run the test due to mid refactor of parser gone wrong :)

Scanner works and test run successfully when broken parser doesn't get in the way
